problem:


while developing microservices following situations came in

service was 
- independent (needed only databases and cache access) e.g auth
- dependent (needed other service[s] for it's functionality) e.g file -> auth, shop -> auth, price -> shop & price -> auth


in independent case
app: runs on local system through in built exec
databases: docker pulled and expose ports 


in dependent case
app: runs on local system through in built exec
databases: docker pulled and expose ports
other grpc servers: compose.yaml file created to run the services 

***** AS YOU CAN SEE I HAVE TO RUN DATABASES SEPARATELY THEN CREATE SEPARATE FILE FOR THIS RUNNING(DIFF FOR 
***** WITHOUT APP BEING INCLUDED IN COMPOSE.YAML FILE AND WITH APP BEING INCLUDED)

solution:

- write all services in one compose.yaml file then run the cli tool
- then select from menu what is the service that you want to run locally
- get depends_on list of the service from the compose file
- add all the services whose name are on the depends on list (do this recursively for their dependent services as well, make sure to detect cycles)
- create a yaml file with (ask user for name of the new file compose file) name.
- write it in the current user location
